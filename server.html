  <h2>Ring adapter(HTTP server) with async and websocket extenstion</h2>
{% highlight clojure %}
(:use org.httpkit.server)
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The server uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and scalable.
    It's written to conform to the standard Clojure web server
    <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring spec</a>, with asynchronous and websocket extension.
    HTTP Kit is (<a href="migration.html">almost</a>) drop-in replacement of ring-jetty-adapter
  </p>

  <h3 id="options" class="anchor">Hello, Clojure HTTP server</h3>
  <p> <code>run-server</code> starts a Ring-compatible HTTP server. You may want to do <a href="#routing">routing with compojure</a></p>

    <li><code>:max-line</code>: length limit for HTTP inital line and per header,
      414(Request-URI Too Long) will be returned if exceeds this limit, default to 4096(4K),

  <h3 class="anchor" id="channel">Unified Async/Websocket API</h3>
<p class="red">The with-channel API is not compatible with the RC releases. The new is better and much easier to understand and use. The old's documentation is <a href="server_old.html">here</a></p>

<p>Unified asynchronous channel interface for HTTP (streaming or long-polling) and WebSocket.</p>

Channel defines the following contract:
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>open?</code>: Returns true iff channel is open.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>close</code>: Closes the channel. Idempotent: returns true if the channel was actually closed, or false if it was already closed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>websocket?</code>: Returns true iff channel is a WebSocket.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>send!</code>:
    Sends data to client and returns true if the data was successfully sent, or false if the channel is closed. Normally, check the returned value is not needed.
    <div class="send-doc">
      <p class="red">Data is sent directly to the client, NO RING MIDDLEWARE IS APPLIED.</p>
      <p>Data form: {:headers _ :status _ :body _} or just body. Note that :headers
        and :status will be stripped for WebSockets and for HTTP streaming responses
        after the first.</p>
    </div>

  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-receive</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [message-string || byte[]) for notification of client WebSocket
    messages. Message ordering is guaranteed by server.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-close</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [status]) for notification of channel being closed by the
    server or client. Handler will be invoked at most once. Useful for clean-up
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="websocket" class="anchor">Websocket example</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Two way communication bettween client and server</li>
  <li>Can Easy degradate to HTTP long polling/streaming, since the unified API</li>
  <li>
    <code>send!</code> with <code>java.lang.String</code>, a text frame assembled and sent to client
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>send!</code> with <code>java.io.InputStream</code> or <code>byte[]</code>, a binary frame assembled and sent to client
  </li>
  <li>For WebSocket Secure connection, one option is <a href="https://github.com/bumptech/stud">stud</a> (self-signed certificate may not work with websocket).
    <a href="http://nginx.com/news/nginx-websockets.html">Nginx</a> can do it too.</li>

<h3 id="handshake" class="anchor">Control WebSocket handshake</h3>
    <p>The <code>with-channel</code> does the websocket handshake automatically. In case if you want to control it, eg: support websocket handshake.
      <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/issues/64">Here</a> is a working around. cgmartin has a <a href="https://gist.github.com/cgmartin/5880732">gist</a>, is a good place to get inspired.</p>

  <h3 id="routing" class="anchor">Routing with Compojure</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> Can be used to do the routing, based on uri and method

  <h3 class="anchor" id="deploy">Recommended server deployment</h3>
  <p>http-kit runs alone happily, handy for development and quick deployment.
    Use of a reverse proxy like <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a>,
    <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighthttpd</a>, etc in serious production is encouraged.
    They can also be used to <a href="migration.html#https">add https support</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They are fast, heavily optimized for static contents.</li>
    <li>They can be configured to compress the content sent to browsers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sample Nginx configration:</p>
  {% highlight sh %}
upstream http_backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:8090;  # http-kit listen on 8090
    # put more server here for load balance
    # keepalive(resue TCP connection) improves performance
    keepalive 32;  # both http-kit and nginx are good at concurrency
}

server {
    location /static/ {  # static contents
        alias   /var/www/xxxx/public/;
    }
    location / {
        proxy_pass  http://http_backend;

        # tell http-kit to keep the connection
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/xxxx.access.log;
    }
}
